## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Help us improve by submitting detailed bug reports:

1. Use a **clear, descriptive title** to highlight the issue.
2. Provide step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue, including commands or actions you performed.
3. Share examples, snippets, or links to demonstrate the issue, using [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines) when necessary.
4. Describe the actual behavior, why it’s problematic, and what you expected instead.
5. Attach screenshots or GIFs to visualize the issue.
6. Include any relevant details about performance or memory issues.
7. Answer these questions for context:
   - Can you reproduce the problem in safe mode?
   - Did the problem start recently, or has it always been an issue?
   - Can it be reproduced in older versions of the software?
   - Does the issue happen consistently or only under specific conditions?
   - Is it limited to certain files, projects, or environments?

### First Code Contribution

If you’re new to contributing, start with these labeled issues:

- **Beginner issues**: Simple tasks requiring minimal coding.  
- **Help wanted issues**: Slightly more involved tasks.  

Both lists are sorted by comment count, indicating the potential impact of changes.

### Submitting Pull Requests

To ensure high-quality contributions:

1. Follow the style guides.
2. Verify that all status checks pass before submitting. If checks fail due to unrelated reasons, explain why in a comment.
3. Reviewers may request additional tests, design work, or changes before acceptance.

### Git Commit Messages

- Use present tense (e.g., "Add feature").
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters.
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line.
- For documentation-only changes, include `[ci skip]` in the title.
- Optionally use emojis to categorize commits:
  - :art: Code format/structure improvements  
  - :bug: Bug fixes  
  - :memo: Documentation updates  
  - :fire: Code/file removals  

### Documentation Style Guide

- Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).
- Reference methods and classes with `{}` notation:
  - `{ClassName}` for classes.
  - `{ClassName::methodName}` for instance methods.
  - `{ClassName.methodName}` for class methods.
